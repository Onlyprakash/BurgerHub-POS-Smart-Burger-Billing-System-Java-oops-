# 📋 Project Overview :-

**BurgerHub** is a Java-based object-oriented programming (OOP) project that simulates a simple yet realistic burger ordering system.  
It demonstrates **real-world application design using classes, methods, encapsulation, and dynamic pricing**, making it a great example of OOP fundamentals in action.

This project is ideal for **students, beginners, and learners** who want to understand how to structure modular Java programs while solving real-world business problems.


# 🚀 Features :-

✅  🍔 Choose between **Veg** or **Non-Veg** burgers. 

✅  🧀 Option to **add extra cheese**.  

✅  🌶️ Option to **add extra toppings**. 

✅  📦 Add **takeaway packaging** charges. 

✅  💰 **Automatic bill calculation** based on selected customizations.

✅  🧾 Generates a clean, itemized **final bill**.


# 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used :-

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Class & Object** | The `BurgerHub` class acts as the blueprint for burger creation. |
| **Encapsulation** | Private fields with controlled access via public methods. |
| **Constructor** | Initializes burger type and base price. |
| **Abstraction** | Hides internal calculations; user interacts through clear methods. |
| **Method Invocation** | Real-world flow simulated via multiple methods (addOns, billing, etc). |
